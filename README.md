# Magintervention
A business use-case born within a bootcamp, using SQL and Tableau

## Summary
Eniac, a fantasy online seller of high-end Apple products wants to emerge into the Brazilian merket. To realise this, they planned to partner up with the already settled online seller Magist.
Magist provided limited data insight to their products palette, customer behaviour and orders. Based on this database, several business questions were answered to elaborate, if Magist is a fitting partner to emerge into the new market.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- Database provided by school
- MySQL
- Tableau

## Key Learnings
Being the first project conducted on Tableau, learnings in the software were big. Multiple plots were generated and deepened the understanding of how the program works.
Also the security in writing SQL enhanced, since the given database required a new level of navigating through its layers in order to get answers out of it.
At last the economical topic of it is a yet unknown field that got discovered through business-fit presentation slides, narrowing down plot-informations and key messages to a minimum.

## Challenges Overcame
Creating easily readable plots within Tableau was a significant challenge, that could not be solved within itself in the end. Instead a mix of Tableaus output and layout features of google slides were used to create simple yet tangible plots.
